# Impacts on Society

**Course**: Introduction to Computer Science - an introductory level course for students in Grades 6 - 8 to learn basic coding using Scratch using the [Project Stem](https://projectstem.org/) curriculum. Project Stem's motto is that "every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science and STEM." <br>

Hence, the following plan will be implemented with the goal in mind to help students understand how computer science makes an impact on the greater society due to its prevalence in many fields of study. Students will also be inspired by the diversity of the featured presenters in the videos, to continue with studying computer science so that they, themselves, will be part of the greater impact on society in the future. <br>

The following lesson plan will outline a major project during the course of study, which will be revisited often to remind the students of the diverse computer scientists in the world and their impact to the world.

# Plan

## Learning Objectives

1. Students will research a computer scientist who has made a great impact on society. The heroes featured will be from a diverse group of people, who represent the following underrepresented demographics in computer science: women, Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, non-native English speakers, and the LBGTQ+ community.<br>
2. Students will create a slideshow on an important person in computer science history.

## Learning Activities

Students will begin the project by watching a video from [code.org](https://code.org/) on how computer science is changing everything. Some guiding questions will be asked for discussion: What are the different fields you notice in the videos? How has computer science impacted those fields? What do you find surprising?
Students will be asked to note the different fields in which they see computer science being used.<br>
<br>
In groups of 4-5 students will create a tree map that identifies the different industries in which they realize are impacted by computer science.
They will define specific areas within that industry in which computer science has improved that field.<br>
<br>
Students will next research computer scientists from [csedweek.org](https://www.csedweek.org) and [techprep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xFJM3QQ3TE). 
On Google Slides, students will create the presentation with the following:<br>
1. **Background Information**: <br>
    a. Name of the computer scientist, what they studied in college (if applicable)<br>
    b. Occupation. <br>
    c. A picture of the person if available can be placed here.<br>
2. **Impact**: The student will explain how the person made an impact on their field, which in turn, makes an impact on society. What solution did the person provide in their field? Are there other possibilities we could use this application/computing to solve problems in the world?<br>
3. **Inspiration**:The student will describe what is inspiring about the person’s background, creation, or innovation considering computer science. The student will answer the following: How does the person inspire people from different backgrounds 

Each small group will work together to put their slides onto one master slideshow. They will present their computer science heroes to the class as a small group. This will support English learners and others who may not feel as secure presenting on their own.

## Assessment

To assess the learning objectives, the teacher will follow a 4 point rubric based off of [projectstem.org](projectstem.org) for each part of the assignment (Background Information, Impact, and Inspiration):<br>
	4 - All requirements are met.<br>
	3 - Most requirements are met.<br>
	2 -  Half of the requirements are met.<br>
	1 -  Little or no requirements are met.<br>


## Outcomes

Since the people the students will meet in the videos are from many diverse backgrounds, representing the following demographics: women, Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, non-native English speakers, and the LBGTQ+ community, this plan will assist in facilitating diversity/equity/inclusion. Moreover, by placing the students in small groups to work and present together, English learners will have some peer support. I believe that [code.org](code.org) and [projectstem.org](projectstem.org) have done a great job at making all students feel included by representing people in the industry who you don’t usually see on the cover of Time magazine. <br>
<br>
In essence, students will have the opportunity to research and/or learn from their classmates about different computer scientists from a variety of fields, who represent diverse backgrounds. Most importantly, by doing this research, the student should feel empowered to learn computer science and to make their own impact in the world despite any challenges they may face.
