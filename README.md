# Impacts on Society

Course: Introduction to Computer Science - an introductory level course for students in Grades 6 - 8 to learn basic coding using Scratch.

The goal of this plan is to help students understand how computer science makes an impact on the greater society due to its prevalence in many fields of study. Students will also be inspired by the diversity of the featured presenters in the videos.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

-Students will research a computer scientist who has made a great impact on society.<br>
-Students will create a slideshow on an important person in computer science history.

### Learning Activities

Students will begin the lesson by watching a video from code.org on how computer science is changing everything.
Students will be asked to note the different fields in which they see computer science being used.
In groups of 4-5 students will create a tree map that identifies the different industries in which they realize are impacted by computer science. They will define specific areas within that industry in which computer science has improved that field.
Students will next research computer scientists from csedweek.org and techprep. 
On Google Slides, students will create the presentation with the following:
Background Information: Name of the computer scientist, what they studied in college (if applicable), occupation. A picture of the person if available can be placed here.
Impact: The student will explain how the person made an impact on their field, which in turn, makes an impact on society. What problem did the scientist solve? Are there other possibilities we could use this application/computing to solve problems in the world?
Inspiration:The student will describe what is inspiring about the person’s background, creation, or innovation considering computer science.

### Assessment

To assess the learning objectives, the teacher will follow a 4 point rubric based off of projectstem.org for each part of the assignment (Background Information, Impact, and Inspiration):
	4 - All requirements are met.
	3 - Most requirements are met.
	2 -  Half of the requirements are met.
	1 -  Little or no requirements are met.


### Outcomes

Since the people the students will meet in the videos are from many diverse backgrounds, this plan will assist in facilitating diversity/equity/inclusion. I believe that code.org and projectstem.org have done a great job at making all students feel included by representing people in the industry who you don’t usually see on the cover of Time magazine. Students will have the opportunity to research and/or learn from their classmates about different computer scientists from a variety of fields, who represent diverse backgrounds. Most importantly, by doing this research, the student should feel empowered to learn computer science and to make their own impact in the world despite any challenges they may face.
